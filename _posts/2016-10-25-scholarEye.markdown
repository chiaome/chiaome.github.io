### 1 Introduction
One month ago, we developed the <a href="/2016/08/10/the-prototype-system-of-visual-analysis/" target="\_blank">prototype system of visual relevance analysis</a> to help the user discover potential and relevant academic informations. Although the <a href="/2016/08/10/the-prototype-system-of-visual-analysis/" target="\_blank">previous system</a> are available for basic functions such as retrieving academic knowledge base, discovering related entities, it has some <a>limitation</a> that need to be improved. I decide to redesign the visual relevant analysis system. In this article, I present my design ideas.

Compared to the previous system, the new system, *ScholarEye*, enhance the ability of interaction with users. As shown in Fig. 1, there are mainly five changes in the new version:

1.    *Integrating all functions into a single analysis session (inspired by TextTile <sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup> );*
2.    *Introducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine" target="\_blank">Meta-search Engine</a>;*
3.    *Using drag-and-drop mechanism;*
4.    *Improving the representation of entity relationship diagram;*
5.    *Adding operable panel for each node.*

### 2 System description
Fig. 2 shows the architecture of *ScholarEye*. This system consists of three main components: (a) a **data layer** that provides the data sources; (b) a **logic layer** that aims to provide supports for a set of visual operations; and (c) a **user interface** that allows the user to analyze with an intuitive way.

<center><b>Fig. 2.</b> System Overview</center>

#### 2.1 Data model
In this system, **Data layer** includes tow parts: (a) academic knowledge base (**AKB**); (b) open-ended internet resources.

#### 2.1.1 AKB
We have developed an **AKB** in the previous system. We plan to improve and perfect it based on the previous **AKB**. We adopt  some strategies:

1.    Adding the properties for entities via Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.baidu.com" target="\_balnk">Baidu baike</a>;
2.    Entity alignment using machine learning;
3.    Relation extraction through joint reasoning;

#### 2.1.2 Open-ended internet resource

The **AKB** we developed only consists of academic information. Sometimes, the user need  access to other types  of information such as blog, news and E-magazine. Considering that the scope of **AKB**, we plan to provide access to **open-ended internet resource**.

### 2.2 Logic layer
This module aims to provide supports for a set of visual operations and includes two main parts: (a) **Query and Calculate** , (b) **Meta-search engine**.  

#### 2.2.1 Query and Calculate
The part is mainly charge of  dealing with the request of the **user interface** and the response of AKB. The details are explained in the Section 2.3.

#### 2.2.2 Meta-search engine
We plan to embed Google search engine in *ScholarEye* to extend data sources. When the user enters keywords in the Google search box, the entities that the retrieved results contain can be automatically recognized and labeled using named entity recognition technology. In order to automatically mark named entities, we need insert javascript codes into the response of *Google search*. There are tow ways: (a)writing an Chrome extension; (b)building an Proxy Server. Currently, we are trying to insert javascript codes through an Proxy Server.

### 2.3 User interface
This system interface mainly is divided in five main panels, as shown in Fig.3,  (a) menu, (b) Google search, (c) split, (d) filter, and (e) operation panels.

<center><b>Fig. 3.</b> User interface</center>


#### 2.3.1 Menu
The **menu** panel (inspired by the Mac OS X dock) provides access to such functions as  opening other application panels, saving current analysis status and restoring analysis status.
As shown in Fig.4, there are two sections to the **menu** panel - the left-hand which deals with applications, and the right-hand side which is where you will find minimised windows. To use an item in the **menu** panel, click its icon. If you want to open **Google search** panel, click the Google icon (the icon with  letter "G"). When an application is open, the **menu** panel displays an illuminated background on the application's icon.

#### 2.3.1 Google search
Already mentioned earlier, **Google search** panel aims to embed Google search engine in this system to extend data sources. As shown in Fig. 5, when the panel is started, it displays Google search interface. The user can enter keywords in the search box to search in the whole Internet. When the results are generated, the named entities in the webpage will be automatically marked by  setting an background  color. Each entity is given a drag-and-drop property, which allow the user to drag entities to the **split** panel.

</a>
<center><b>Fig. 5.</b> Google search</center>

#### 2.3.2 Split
The **split** panel (inspired by TextTile <sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup> )  displays the entities with the same name. The user can drag-and-drop an entity from the **filter**, **operation**, or **Google search** panel onto the **split** panel where the different entities stored in **AKB** with the same name will be exhibited automatically, as shown in Fig. 5.

#### 2.3.3 Filter
The **filter** panel provides access for users to retrieve **AKB**. This panel can accept not only the keywords that the user enters manually but also the entities that are dragged from the **operation**, **split** and **Google search** panel. As shown in Fig. 6, the results are divided into three categories: **related scholars**, **related papers** and **related organizations**.

</a>
<center><b>Fig. 6.</b> Filter</center>

#### 2.3.4 Operation
The purpose of the **operation** panel is to automatically display and analyze the relations between entities. The user can drag-and-drop entities from the **filter** and **split** panel onto the **operation** panel which provides a series of operations, as shown in Fig. 7, to query, analyze and arrange entities.
